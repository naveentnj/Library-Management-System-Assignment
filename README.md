# Library Management System in Python

This repository implements a library management system using Python with Object-Oriented Design principles. It offers functionalities for managing users, books, and checkouts, ensuring data persistence through file-based storage (JSON).

## Features

### User Management
- Add, update, delete, and list users.
- Search for users by name or ID.

### Book Management
- Add, update, delete, and list books.
- Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- Track book availability (checked out or available).

### Checkout Management
- Checkout books for users.
- Return books for users.

### Data Persistence
- Stores user and book data in JSON files for persistence.

## Benefits of using this code

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects for clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Code is organized into modules for better organization and reusability.
- **Error Handling**: Handles potential errors during user input and data operations.
- **File-based Storage**: Ensures data persists even after program termination.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a basic command-line interface for user interaction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries (likely `json` for JSON handling).
3. Run the `main.py` script to start the library management system.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Add functionalities like due dates for books and late fee calculations.
- Allow managing other library items (e.g., audiobooks).
- Integrate user authentication and authorization features.

This project provides a solid foundation for a library management system using Python. You can extend it further based on your specific requirements.
